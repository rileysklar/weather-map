Refactor the map component to enable a "Create Project Site" feature where users can click a button to toggle creation mode, fill out a form with a title and description, and select a polygon area on the map. Ensure the component manages the form and polygon data in state and sends this data to the Supabase backend via a new service function in the services folder. Keep all code changes within the front-end folder, leveraging existing design and UI components. Focus on clean integration, user-friendly interactions, and clear feedback for successful or failed submissions.
